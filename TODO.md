The introduction should explain why they should accept you.
Whatever I say in the abstract and introduction needs to be supported by the evidence later in the paper.
The introduction should be very simple.
We need to be very particular about how we improve about these algorithms.
We need to be very careful about how our runtime works.

In the introduction I should use the references that suit myself best to tell my story.
Only 5 references that are about what I improve over. "...and we improve upon this by blah blah".
We only introduce as little notation as possible.
We need to explain how integer lattice submodularity is different than set submodularity.
Explain what Soma, Mirzasoleiman have been doing recently.
Add "Our Contribution" "In this paper, we show that ".
- approximation ratio
- theoretical runtime
- We show that the dependence of parameters on the number of value oracle queries scales better
- We represent an extensive evaluation of these algorithms on 3 well-known example problems.

In the related works section, the purpose is to present broader results in submodularity. (~20 references).

Introduction should be about 1 page.
